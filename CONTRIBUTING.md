# file explainations
There are only a few files to be concerned with:
`main.go` - simply starts the wm
`wm/window_manager.go` - the whole window manager in that one single file (don't worry it is commented)
`exampleConfig/` - this folder contains the example configuration that a user should copy into their .config on first installation
`MakeFile` - the MakeFile to install the WM
